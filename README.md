///ROLL OUT PRODUCTION - NOOOW

///TO IMPLEMENT///

- Commenting
+ Likes
- Check whether count is done correctly lkes/comments/views
+ Icon and when uploading another message
- Make filters for DUMYs by topics, make so that by default displayed are all but u can checkout what u dont want to see 
- Also u cd make filter by most popular but... Won't it make a loop for popularity? Better make filter by comments, yea, that makes, sense, by likes as well, though not by viwes but does it make sense then?
- Change text for when click on heart and info, also so that there wdnt be "Alert"

!!! When that part is ready, make in "books" the error or smth or just from the database list of who lended, when, for how long.
Actually that might be genious and maybe I don't need more
Though it'll work just for up to 100books or smth, to handle 5-10 orders per day I can myself which is like 50$ in book's value per day so... It sd work 100% on the start.
Even if there will be more u can just find volunteers that wd do that or even pay a bit to them.

I don't see the way to automate it tbh, it'll become in handy when I will have my own bookstore/coffeeshop or smth, because there will be external 
well build databse with QRs sendings etc

Though, let's deploy v1 and we will see.

Books 
- Make on firebase to display 
-which book
-who lended
-until when
-book value
-city/adress in which it can be handed over
-contact info (phone)
-comment on book
